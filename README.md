# Git practice 
1. Please use git merge to merge branch **feature1**, and check git logs.

2. Checkout to **feature2** branch, and use git rebase to merge branch **master**, then check the logs.

3. Still in **feature2** branch, add a new name into names.txt, and try to switch back to **master** branch, see what happens.

4. Use git stash to stash your local changes and then checkout to **master**.
